About this directory
====================

This directory contains templates as part of the Doulos Easier SystemC Using
Modern C++ effort. In some cases, templates are really just the source
code with no template aspects, but many are real templates. These are all
designed to be used with the `new` script.

## Warning: _**Under development -- not fully tested**_

Usage
-----
Add this directory to your `TEMPLATEPATH` environment variable or to your `.newrc`
initialization file. This will allow it to be searched when using the `new` script
to create files.

Usage
-----

See `new` script in bin/ sub-directory.
