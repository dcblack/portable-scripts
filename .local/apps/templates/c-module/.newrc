=head1 NAME

B<c-module template> - Creates a C module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<new> B<c-module> [-d {:I<DIR>:}] {:I<NAME>:}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The idea of a C module is to create an object-like set of functions with data and configuration structures.
All function names associated with the module (?class?) will start with the {:NAME:}_ prefix.
All functions will likely pass at least one pointer to either the data object or a config object.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

C compiler

=head1 EXAMPLE

    % new c-module timer
    % gcc -std=c11 -o timer.o -c timer.c
