# About this project

If you are an instructor, you should have or create your own personal folder
underneath the INSTRUCTORS directory.

Course exercises are located in their respective top-level folder underneath
the EXERCISES directory.

Information on how this project is to be used may be found under the
TRAINING-INFO directory.

The next section is a slightly more detailed explanation of the directory
and file layout of this project.

## Instructors Code

Note: The Instructors' Code is similar to the Pirates Code. They are
      guidelines really, but don't take them too lightly.

1. Do not place anything personal in the $HOME directory.
   1. This includes course files, terminals, x11 files
   2. Personal files go under your personal folder under INSTRUCTORS/$INSTRUCTOR
   3. Course files go under ${HOME}/COURSES/$YYYY/$YYYY-$MM-$DD-$COURSE.course
   4. Terminals go under your personal folder
   5. If you forget, move them as soon as you remember
   6. If you leave files around, somebody else might move them under
      the LOST_N_FOUND directory.
2. If you edit the bashrc and other configuration files,
   you are setting it up for all your colleagues.
   1. Dotfiles (including vim) are located under ${HOME}/.local/dotfiles
   2. Dotfiles are revision controlled under Vim
   3. You may create your own branch and then modify them to your liking
   4. If it appears confused, you can get back to the basics by checking
      out the `main` branch.
   5. If you don't know how to use Git, ask and learn!
   6. If you don't check in your changes, somebody else may remove or stash them.
   7. If you find junk blocking your way when changing branches, you have every
      right to stash or trash them. See previous item.
   8. Try to follow good Linux directory/file naming rules =~ m/^[[:alpha:]][-_[:alnum:]]+/ (i.e., no whitespace)
