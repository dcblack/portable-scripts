# About scripts/

This directory contains BASH scripts that each contain respectively a very few related user-defined functions (often only one). These are to be sourced by the `dotfile` `functions`.  This was done to simplify understanding and testing. 

Most of the script names use a convention of word or sentence case. This allows them to be distinguished from normal executable programs, which rarely ever have any but lowercase.
